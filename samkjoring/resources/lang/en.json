  "aboutText": "The reason for our project is that many people drive alone to work or school, among other things, while the use of public transport is relatively low (although it has gradually increased in recent years (Statistics Norway, 2019)) or where the offer of public transport is reduced. There is also a lot of awareness about the climate issue at the moment, and we think this can be a measure to improve the environment. That is why we want to create an application that will make it easier for people to arrange interconnection if they are going the same way."
