  "aboutText": "HAIK started in 1922 in a small house in Rjukan when Kjell Berit Kongshavn got his first tandem bike. Inspired by the example set by the tandem bike and the togetherness in Rjukan Bedehus, Kjell Berit started HAIK. During fall 2019 Kjell Berit found out that he wanted to expand his business to the internet. Then the proffesional developers \"Gruppe4\" were put to the case!"
